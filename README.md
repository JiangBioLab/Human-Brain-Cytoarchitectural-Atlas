# Cytoarchitectural atlas of human cerebral cortex

Establishing a cytoarchitectural atlas of human cerebral cortex is of high importance for understanding the cellular basis of human intelligence. Advent technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing have empowered us to decipher the cellular basis of complex tissues. Previous studies described neuronal properties with telencephalic heterogeneity and spatial cellular features in one or two cortical regions of mammals at the single-cell level, as well as regional heterogeneity of cell types across the entire mouse nervous system. However, there is no large-scale census of human cortical neuronal cell types and even their cellular architecture in multiple brain regions of human.

In this study, we built a cytoarchitectural atlas of adult human cerebral cortex. We characterized the cellular diversity and spatial structure of the human cortex by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST). We discovered that glutamatergic neurons tend to be restricted to certain layers more than what was previously thought, and found interneurons derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence to reside mainly in the supragranular layer. Besides, we also leverage the cytoarchitectural atlas to locate L4 and L6b with their highly relevant cell types. Our comprehensive atlas of cellular diversity and spatial arrangement in human cortex provided new biological insights into the molecular and cellular basis of human intelligence.
